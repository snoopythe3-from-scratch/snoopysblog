# Submit an article
## If you have read permissions... 
Firstly, write your article using the editor on our website. Make sure you input the date name and title. There is no need to have a heading that says your article name, because that is rendered already. Then, make a GitHub account if you don't already have one and go to our Issues page and create a new blank issue. Copy in the markdown you've downloaded (including the table part) and soon a developer will add it in.
## If you have write permissions... 
Add it at the beginning of index.json, going from newest to oldest, because the article system does not sort by date but rather order in index.json.
